Additionally, the system provides functionalities for users to search for contacts either by name or by city, making it easy to find specific information. If needed, users can also delete a contact by name. The application stores the contact information in a fixed-size array with a maximum capacity of 500 contacts. Overall, the system offers an efficient and intuitive way to manage contacts, providing essential features like adding, displaying, searching, and deleting with a simple menu-driven interface.
